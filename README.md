# Heroes
Project for a technical test featuring a basic super-hero CRUD, tribute to original heroes tutorial by John Papa 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.
You can load a list of heroes, edit, add or delete new entries.
The application use a local temporal list that will be recreated each time you reload a page.
The services are simulated using an interceptor that load a local json file, and the same technique is used to show the loading spinner (delayed for 1 second, since thereÂ´s no loading time because data is local)
Basic unit testing is in place. The list of heroes comes from the original Heroes tutorial. 
where everyone begins at some point.
We use Angular Material as the base build elements for the whole app.
